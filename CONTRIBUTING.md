## Branch and PR Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Keep changes focused and atomic.
3. Add or update tests when behavior changes.
4. Run `npm run format`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build` before opening a PR.
5. Open a PR with clear context and impact.

## Coding Guidelines

- TypeScript first, strict typing, avoid `any`.
- Prefer small, composable modules.
- Preserve existing style and naming conventions.

## Commit Messages

Use concise, imperative commit messages (e.g. `add X`, `refactor Y`, `fix Z`).

## Questions

For general discussion and roadmap feedback, open a GitHub Discussion or issue.
