# mount0

A virtual filesystem reverse proxy powered by FUSE and Node.js. Mount0 lets you “mount” remote APIs, S3 buckets, or any HTTP resource as a local filesystem. Built in TypeScript with FUSE support, it bridges the gap between web services and traditional file access — ideal for integrations, syncing, and automation.
