Mount0 was built to rethink how we interact with distributed storage systems.\n\n<!-- truncate -->\n\n## The Problem with S3-like Abstractions\n\nWhile object storage is cheap and durable, treating it like a filesystem often leads to performance pitfalls. Listing millions of objects is slow. Latency is unpredictable. Mount0 introduces a smart caching layer that understands the *semantics* of your data, not just the bytes.\n\n## Features at a Glance\n\n*   **Zero-Copy Streaming**: Pass data through from source to client with minimal overhead.\n*   **Intelligent Prefetching**: Our algorithms learn access patterns to pre-warm cache for sequential reads.\n*   **Unified namespace**: Mount multiple buckets and providers into a single, cohesive file tree.\n\nMount0 isn't just a driver; it's a new way to think about cloud-native IO."}],"blogListPaginated":[{"items":["storage-for-the-future"],"metadata":{"permalink":"/blog","page":1,"postsPerPage":10,"totalPages":1,"totalCount":1,"blogDescription":"Blog","blogTitle":"Blog"}}],"blogTags":{"/blog/tags/cloud":{"inline":true,"label":"cloud","permalink":"/blog/tags/cloud","items":["storage-for-the-future"],"pages":[{"items":["storage-for-the-future"],"metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/tags/cloud","page":1,"postsPerPage":10,"totalPages":1,"totalCount":1,"blogDescription":"Blog","blogTitle":"Blog"}}],"unlisted":false},"/blog/tags/storage":{"inline":true,"label":"storage","permalink":"/blog/tags/storage","items":["storage-for-the-future"],"pages":[{"items":["storage-for-the-future"],"metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/tags/storage","page":1,"postsPerPage":10,"totalPages":1,"totalCount":1,"blogDescription":"Blog","blogTitle":"Blog"}}],"unlisted":false},"/blog/tags/infrastructure":{"inline":true,"label":"infrastructure","permalink":"/blog/tags/infrastructure","items":["storage-for-the-future"],"pages":[{"items":["storage-for-the-future"],"metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/tags/infrastructure","page":1,"postsPerPage":10,"totalPages":1,"totalCount":1,"blogDescription":"Blog","blogTitle":"Blog"}}],"unlisted":false}},"blogTagsListPath":"/blog/tags","authorsMap":{"mensreversa":{"name":"Mens Reversa Team","title":"Maintainers","url":"https://github.com/mensreversa","imageURL":"https://github.com/mensreversa.png","key":"mensreversa","page":null}}}},"docusaurus-plugin-content-pages":{"default":null},"docusaurus-plugin-debug":{},"docusaurus-plugin-svgr":{},"docusaurus-theme-classic":{},"docusaurus-plugin-typedoc":{},"docusaurus-bootstrap-plugin":{},"docusaurus-mdx-fallback-plugin":{}}}
