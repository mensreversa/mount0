Mount0 was built to rethink how we interact with distributed storage systems.\n\n<!-- truncate -->\n\n## The Problem with S3-like Abstractions\n\nWhile object storage is cheap and durable, treating it like a filesystem often leads to performance pitfalls. Listing millions of objects is slow. Latency is unpredictable. Mount0 introduces a smart caching layer that understands the *semantics* of your data, not just the bytes.\n\n## Features at a Glance\n\n*   **Zero-Copy Streaming**: Pass data through from source to client with minimal overhead.\n*   **Intelligent Prefetching**: Our algorithms learn access patterns to pre-warm cache for sequential reads.\n*   **Unified namespace**: Mount multiple buckets and providers into a single, cohesive file tree.\n\nMount0 isn't just a driver; it's a new way to think about cloud-native IO."}]}}
